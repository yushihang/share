One thing I’ve been working on is pulling back a bit from the details. As a developer, I’m used to diving deep — I like to make sure everything’s just right. But that sometimes spills over into areas like risk assessment, where I used to get caught up in edge cases or small technical stuff, instead of looking at the bigger picture.

Now that I’m stepping more into a leadership role, I’ve been learning to zoom out, focus on what really matters, and trust the team to handle the details. It’s definitely still something I’m working on, but I’m a lot more mindful of it now and trying to strike a better balance.
